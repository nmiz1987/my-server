# My Personal Server

## Info
This server is built for my personal use, but fill free to download, copy, and fork for your needs.

I decided to store my DB in [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), specificity in Atlas, but you can store in anywhere. 

## Packages
The server required the following packages:
1. bcrypt.
2. cors.
3. dotenv.
4. express.
5. jsonwebtoken.
6. mongodb.
7. mongoose.

## Scripts
You can run the server by `npm run start` for production or `npm run server` for development (users nodemon to auto-restart after saving).
